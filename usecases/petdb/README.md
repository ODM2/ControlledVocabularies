EarthChem PetDB Data Use Case
=============================

#### Database Description ####

PetDB, The Petrological Database, http://www.earthchem.org/petdb, is a global synthesis of chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical data for rocks, minerals, and melt inclusions. PetDB's current content focuses on data for
igneous and metamorphic rocks from the ocean floor, specifically mid-ocean ridge basalts and abyssal peridotites, and
xenolith samples from the Earth's mantle and lower crust.

#### Data Source Information ####

**Contact:** Kerstin Lehnert

**Email:** info@earthchem.org

**Organization:** Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University

#### Temporal Information ####

Currently not implemented for geochemical analyses as this is usually not included in the published references. However, the year of publication of data is useful information about the analysis techniques of the time.

#### Observation Types ####

Laboratory sample analysis.

#### Measured Variables ####

Data types include: Age, End-Member, Major Oxide/Element, Model Data, Nobel Gas, Radiogenic Isotopes, Rare Earth Element, Ratio, Rock Mode, Speciation Ratio, Stable Isotopes, Trace Element, Uranium Series, Volatile

As of 9/5/2014, there are 502 different measured variables in PetDB
